# Breast-Cancer-Detection-on-Wisconsin-Dataset
This project aims at comparing 3 different classification algorithms on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.
The algorithms are:
1. Decision Trees
2. Random Forests
3. XGBoost (Gradient Boosting)

Achieved an accuracy of 92.9 % for Decision Trees, 95.9% for Random Forests, 96.5% for XGBoost algorithm.
